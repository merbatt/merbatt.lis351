<h2>Bethesda, Maryland</h2>

<p>I'm from Bethesda, Maryland, which is a suburb of Washington DC. It lies just outside of the nation's capital, and along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Bethesda has many attractions from scenic hikes to a modern downtown area with a plethora of restaurants. Bethesda is a short drive from the Delaware and Maryland beaches.<p>
